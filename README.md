<h1 align="center">🙋🏽 About me</h1>
I'm a 17-year-old Python enthusiast just getting started with GitHub.
<br>
I enjoy learning and exploring new things in tech, and I'm currently using EndeavourOS as my main operating system for coding.
<br>
I'm member of my local chess club, therefore I really love playing chess. If there's time, I hang out with my friends or do some biking.
