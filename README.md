Hi, I’m @JohannBogner 👋

👨‍🦱 Partially German (🇩🇪) and Indonesian (🇮🇩)!

📍 Living in Bavaria, Germany.

🏫 Currently going to highschool!

I'm 17 years old and just getting started here on GitHub.
My favorite programming language is Python. I began learning it in 2020 during the covid pandemic.
As my main operating system I'm running Linux, specifically EndeavourOS.

Besides coding with python, I love to play chess (also in a chessclub) and biking.
